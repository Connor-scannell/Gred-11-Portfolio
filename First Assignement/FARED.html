Spooderman
</h1>
<br>

<p>
Spoderman (also known as Spodermen) is an MS Paint character resembling a poorly-drawn version of Spiderman. The character usually appears as a recurring character in Dolan comics or videos. Any content involving Spoderman typically contains poor grammar and spelling, and has many signature phrases such as “an fagit”, and “sweg”.
</p>
<p>
The exact origin is unknown, although Google trends show that the first online instance of ‘Spoderman’ was in April 2007. However it can be assumed that this was unrelated to the Spoderman character, as search interest only starts to inflate consistently in April 2012.
The first video appearance of Spoderman was in a YouTube video uploaded on April 12th, 2012 called The Uncle Dolan Show Episode 1[1], uploaded by a YouTuber named ‘Dolan Duk’. As of February 2015, the video has over 1,200,000 views.
</p>
<p>
After Spoderman’s appearance on The Uncle Dolan Show, search interest for the character began to pick up. A YouTube channel exclusively posting Spodermen videos was started on July 23rd, 2012[2], with its first upload on January 7th, 2013[3]. As of February 2015, the channel has over 11,000,000 total views.
A novelty twitter account for Spodermen has also been created by the YouTuber[4].
The character maintains a significant presence on the subreddit /r/dolan.[5]

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A volcano is a location where magma, or hot melted rock from within a planet, reaches the surface. It may happen violently, in a massive supersonic explosion, or more quietly, as a sticky, slow lava flow.<br>
 Volcanoes have been a part of earth's history long before humans. Compare the history of human beings, a few million years in the making, to that of the Earth, over four billion years in the making.</p>

<p>The term <i>nuée ardente</i>, or "glowing cloud" was first used by La Croix (1904) in his description of the volcanic flows he observed in the 1902 eruption of Mt Pelée, a historically active volcano on the island of Martinique.</p>
<h1> Volcano Places in the USA</h1>
<p>Listed below are two places in the United States that are considered "active" volcanic areas.  </p>
<h4>Mount St Helens</h4>
<p> On May 18, 1980, after a long period of rest, this quiet mountain in Washington provided detailed observations on the mechanics of highly explosive eruptions.  </p>
<h4>Long Valley</h4>
<p> This field seismometer measures earthquakes associated with subsurface volcanic forces and may help to predict future events. It sits on a plateau known as the "Volcanic Tableland" formed by a major eruption 600,000 years ago</p>
